# Introduction

Hi! This is a little microproject I want to do:
I want to compress my years of experience building the API backend of a top-50 Steam game into a bunch of weird, rambling advice that I can deliver with all of the authority of someone who can't differentiate success due to merit from success due to luck.

This started as an idea for a presentation that I could give, in front of a slide deck, but it became a little imposing as it started to extend past 20,000 words and I realized that I'd be talking for over 3 hours. If it does seem a little _brief_ in places, that's why: it was intended (naively) to be delivered in _one unbroken sitting_.

## You
If you don't know the basics of programming, nothing that we cover here is going to make any sense to you. I'm hoping to target an audience of at least junior-level developers who understand how to code but maybe want some advice on the bigger picture story of how to construct an application.

That's what we're here to talk about!
